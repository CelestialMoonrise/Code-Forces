# Code Forces Writeup

Hi there! This is the collection of accepeted code from me working through Code Forces problemsets. I try to include the link to the problem in all the files. All of the code included came from me, so they might be a bit more basic than pro writeups. I'm trying to make my coding more efficient and use less brute force though! This repo will also document the coding I do as I try to get better witht he practice. And maybe it will help you think of your own way to solve? (Anyway, thanks for reading this!)

Once again, this whole repo existed only because of this site -> https://codeforces.com/ !! Go check it out!
